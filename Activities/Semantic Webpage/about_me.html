                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi! I am Trishan Das and I'm from Kolkata, West Bengal. I am very eager to learn new 
                    things and explore the world of computer science. I have always been fascinated by how technology shapes 
                    our daily lives, 
                    and I constantly strive to improve my skills in programming and problem-solving.As far as my hobbies are 
                    concerned, I am passionate about competitive coding, playing the piano, and reading books that challenge my
                     perspective. I also enjoy working on personal projects that allow me to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in real-life 
                     scenarios. My ultimate goal is to contribute to innovative solutions that can make a meaningful 
                     impact on society.
